                        Dev-Build is a project that is developed so as to explore various tech stacks,
                        features each of them offer and how can we use them to solve a problem.
                        An Engineer is always a problem solver :D, so the project is currently about vizualizing the
                        working of some of the algorithms.The project is simple and was developed when I had some free time :).                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These algorithms are visualized with the help of Java backend and Chart Js in front end.

                        This whole project is built on Spring boot and Angular stack.
