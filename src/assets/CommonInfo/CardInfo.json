Once they are divided to the smallest possible unit, we start merging the group with Sorting applied. Two sorted groups can be merged with a linear time complexity O(N). As we are dividing array into two halves every time until the smallest group is achieved this division can go up to ~ log2N. After the division we still have to visit all the elements so as to get them sorted and so the time complexity will be O(NlogN).",
